not done:

delete grid and randomization
    
then fix all bugs (there's a lot)
then implement items maybe (start by randomizing)
then add item types (keys, doors, etc)
add text overrides for items
at some point, setup pygame shit and change display method to GUI
    text scrolling would be needed, maybe a custom textbox class
maybe hallways as special types of rooms (with a split path)
add more directions to the dest array: NE NW SE SW - last priority before hardcoding
    what will be done with vertical rooms (climbing ladders/stairs to go up and down etc) 
objectives - point counter for each item that is collected/used?
process input function ('n' = 'North' = 'north' etc)
explored rooms "to the north is the cellar" if youve explored it, otherwise "to the north is a dark hallway"
item inventory/player class?

make plot and story and hardcode all rooms (last thing)

done:
add text overrides for rooms ("you used the key" "you turned on the light" "you walked down the stairs" "you turned left and went into the cellar)
