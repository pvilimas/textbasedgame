not done:


look at [item]
at some point, setup pygame shit and change display method to GUI
    text scrolling would be needed, maybe a custom textbox class
    extra parameter into display function saying whether this is game or user text and the color is dependent on that maybe
    customInput which is similar to display (returns the input but adds a > at the start)
    blinking cursor for player input
    scrollable text area
    resizable game window
objectives - point counter for each item that is collected/used?
verbose mode?
dynamic commands list ("help") instead of hardcoding it? unlikely
make plot and story and hardcode all rooms (last thing)

optional:
explored rooms "to the north is the cellar" if youve explored it, otherwise "to the north is a dark hallway"
item inventory/player class?
saving game, title screen, other stuff

bugs:
"command not recognized!"

done:
add text overrides for rooms ("you used the key" "you turned on the light" "you walked down the stairs" "you turned left and went into the cellar)
delete grid and randomization
process input function ('n' = 'North' = 'north' etc)
grid bug fixes
fix short room format for NE NW SE SW
inventory added
    inventory checking as a game command
add more directions to the dest array: NE NW SE SW - last priority before hardcoding
implement items maybe (start by randomizing)
    addItem, removeItem methods
        "what do you want to take?"
    looking around in a room as a game command while you're at it

not necessary for now:
    maybe hallways as special types of rooms (with a split path)
        what will be done with vertical rooms (climbing ladders/stairs to go up and down etc)
    add item types (keys, doors, etc)
add text overrides for items - will be done while hardcoding
