not done:

implement items maybe (start by randomizing)
    addItem, removeItem methods
    looking around in a room as a game command while you're at it
add item types (keys, doors, etc)
add text overrides for items
at some point, setup pygame shit and change display method to GUI
    text scrolling would be needed, maybe a custom textbox class
    extra parameter into display function saying whether this is game or user text and the color is dependent on that maybe
maybe hallways as special types of rooms (with a split path)
add more directions to the dest array: NE NW SE SW - last priority before hardcoding
    what will be done with vertical rooms (climbing ladders/stairs to go up and down etc) 
objectives - point counter for each item that is collected/used?
explored rooms "to the north is the cellar" if youve explored it, otherwise "to the north is a dark hallway"
item inventory/player class?

make plot and story and hardcode all rooms (last thing)

saving game, title screen, other stuff
